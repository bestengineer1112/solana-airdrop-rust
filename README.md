# Solana Presale Program

## Development

### Environment Setup

1. Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/
2. Install Solana v1.6.1 or later from https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
3. Install the `libudev` development package for your distribution (`libudev-dev` on Debian-derived distros, `libudev-devel` on Redhat-derived).

### Build

```
$ cd program
$ cargo build-bpf
```

### Deploy
